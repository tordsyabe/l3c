            <strong>We only need an access to your supplierâ€™s invoices and their back-ups</strong> to analyze, verify and understand what you have been invoiced and assure that the invoiced services are the right ones, the back-ups are correct and the invoices respect the laws and regulations applicable in the country of operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the free audit, we will arrange a meeting and present you our findings and provide you a written report.
          </p>

          <p>
            The initial audit report will include the following points :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color: green;"></i> Irregularities identification.</li>

            <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color: green;"></i> Number of invoices concerned.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After which, <strong>should you wish to proceed</strong>, you will be required to sign a mandate of consulting that will allow us to complete our mission. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Our fee is based only on the amount credited by your suppliers at 1/3 of the total amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the size of the project, we will need between one and two months to finalize the mission. Once the contract is signed, we will require a down payment of 20% of the reported credited amount or 500 euros per day per person (generally speaking, the mission requires two consultants).
